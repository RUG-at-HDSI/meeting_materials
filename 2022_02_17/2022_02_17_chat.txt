17:16:24	 From gwynn s : https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html

17:19:04	 From Christian Testa : Earlier when I was talking about piping, I was talking about using the %T>% pipe in combination with head or print
17:19:10	 From Christian Testa : https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/tee.html
17:19:52	 From Christian Testa : Rcpp
17:19:59	 From Christian Testa : microbenchmark
17:20:08	 From Todd Brous | distillet : (OMG‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs a TEEeeee in R!??!?!)
17:20:28	 From Christian Testa : https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/
17:20:34	 From gwynn s : üçµ
17:20:53	 From Daphne Wang : That is awesome!!
17:22:00	 From gwynn s : Apply!!! üçÄ
17:25:24	 From Christian Testa : dtplyr  provides a dplyr syntax with data.table as the backend!
17:25:31	 From Christian Testa : https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/
17:26:41	 From gwynn s : Apply looks like it‚Äôs fast than map: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45101045/why-use-purrrmap-instead-of-lapply
17:29:33	 From Todd Brous | distillet : (I feel like my future has reticulate and Python in it‚Ä¶)
17:29:54	 From Todd Brous | distillet : (Im surrounded by Python people‚Ä¶ and they keep making fun of me.)
17:31:04	 From gwynn s : ü§¨
17:31:15	 From gwynn s : That‚Äôs no good!
17:31:34	 From Todd Brous | distillet : Ha!
17:31:42	 From Christian Testa : Another way to speed up code is to parallelize:
17:31:43	 From Christian Testa : https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jerrick/courses/stat701/notes/parallel.html
17:31:54	 From Katya Zelevinsky : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/readme/README.html
17:32:12	 From Katya Zelevinsky : This is the package I heard that helps run Julia with R
17:32:18	 From Christian Testa : @Katya neat!!
17:32:56	 From Todd Brous | distillet : PEMDAS sucks‚Ä¶ I think the order of operations should be reversed.
17:33:05	 From Todd Brous | distillet : (That was a joke)
17:34:14	 From Todd Brous | distillet : But if it works‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a good thing.
17:37:42	 From Christian Testa : Let‚Äôs say you have some data frame:
17:37:51	 From Christian Testa : df <- data.frame(x = 1)
17:38:06	 From Christian Testa : You can add descriptions to a column like this:
17:38:06	 From Christian Testa : attr(df$x, 'label') <- 'column description text here'>
17:38:22	 From Todd Brous | distillet : My only tip‚Ä¶ is to clear the environment at the beginning of my code.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®rm(list = ls())‚Ä®‚Ä®Figuring that out represented 3 days of trauma‚Ä¶
17:38:39	 From Christian Testa : There‚Äôs also this post about labelled data here:
17:38:40	 From Christian Testa : https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-12-23-leveraging-labelled-data-in-r/
17:38:49	 From gwynn s : üëç
17:40:39	 From Todd Brous | distillet : Dplyr changed my life.  It‚Äôs THE #1 reason I like R over python.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®It just makes sense
17:42:05	 From Todd Brous | distillet : I comment each line
17:42:32	 From Todd Brous | distillet : Granted... at my stage in life‚Ä¶ nobody is every gonna read or use my code
17:42:54	 From Nicole Anne Swartwood : future todd might
17:43:17	 From Christian Testa : ‚ÄúLiterate programming‚Äù
17:43:18	 From Todd Brous | distillet : I have a bunch of, ‚Äú# read the code ya bonehead‚Ä¶‚Äù comments in my code
17:44:33	 From Todd Brous | distillet : Using good variable names is super smart!
17:45:42	 From gwynn s : I need to leave at 6.
17:46:06	 From Darce : I also need to leave at 6:00 for another meeting. Sorry!
